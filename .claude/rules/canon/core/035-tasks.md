# Tasks standards

## Task files

- `.canon/tasks/` is gitignored local session scratch, one file per task. Edit freely. No staging or revert before commits.
- Only create a task for work that spans multiple sessions or has real dependencies. Handle small edits immediately without a task entry.
- Do not add tasks retroactively for work already completed. Completed work is visible in git.
- When a task needs execution detail beyond its own file, create a plan in `.canon/plans/` and link to it from the task's intro paragraph. When that task ships, move its plan file to `.canon/plans/archive/`. Never delete it.
- Write the plan in the same session as the task file. The session that executes the plan later inherits reasoning context it would otherwise have to re-derive.
