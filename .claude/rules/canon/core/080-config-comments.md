# Config comment standards

## Comments

- Keep each comment to one short line. Do not wrap a single key in a multi-line explanation.
- Prefer a one-word category label over a sentence for a group header.
- Match the comment density of the surrounding file. Do not add a verbose comment next to terse ones.
- Comment what a key does or its allowed values. Do not restate the key name.
