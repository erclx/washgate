# Diagrams standards

## Authority

- Follow the diagrams standard for which question an entry answers, the entry kinds and their source signals, the frontmatter, and the explanation prose beneath the fence. It is the single source. Read it with `canon standards diagrams`.
- Layout, budgets, accessibility, labels, and render verification inside the fence are a separate topic. `502-mermaid` routes them to `mermaid.md`.
- A diagram entry carries structure and flow, not implementation. Read the standard before adding or revising a kind.

## Scope

- Write a new diagram to `.canon/diagrams/<kind>.md`, never to `.claude/DIAGRAMS.md`
- Convert a `.claude/DIAGRAMS.md` left by an older install into per-kind entries before editing it
