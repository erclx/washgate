# Plan standards

## The answer contract

- Never fill an `- Answer:` slot on behalf of the person who owns it. A blank slot accepts the suggestion at execution time.
- Never ship a question without a `- Suggested:` line. Write `- Suggested: needs your call, <why>` where the answer turns on preference.
- Rewrite the `- Suggested:` line as `overridden at execution to <pick>,` plus the measurement when execution deviates from an unanswered question, leaving the slot blank. Put the same deviation in one line under the open task's `## Findings`.

## Archiving

- Move a shipped plan to `.canon/plans/archive/`. Never delete one.
- Amend a plan in place when a decision changes. Do not append a second passage narrating the change.

## Authority

- Follow the plan standard for the filename and slug, the required sections, the suggested-and-answer contract, and the lifecycle. It is the single source. Read it with `canon standards plan`.
