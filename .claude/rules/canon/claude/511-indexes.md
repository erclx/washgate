# Index standards

## Generation

- Do not hand-edit an `index.md` that an agent browses to pick a document. Run `canon indexes regen` instead.
- Preserve an `index.md`'s own frontmatter (`title`, `subtitle`). The regen walker keeps it.
- Add `auto: false` to an `index.md`'s frontmatter to keep that folder's index hand-edited.
- Skip `index.md` in a code folder or a scratch folder. Neither needs one.
