# Skill standards

## Before editing

- Confirm `canon:create-skill`'s two creation-time questions are answered before a new `SKILL.md` lands, whether drafted by hand, by another skill, or by `canon:create-skill` itself. Carry the third question into the sibling `REQUIREMENT.md`'s `Must not` section as a review criterion rather than a gate.
- Report it rather than proceeding silently when `canon:create-skill` does not resolve. It ships with the plugin and this rule ships with the CLI, so a project that installed governance alone does not have it.

## After editing

- Re-read a skill body this session edited before invoking that skill again in the same session
- Do not read a resolved file path in a held body as evidence the body is current

## Authority

- Follow the skill standard for skill structure, frontmatter fields, invocation rules, and the shape a `REQUIREMENT.md` states. It is the single source. Read it with `canon standards skill`.
