# British spelling passed at edit time and a corpus check caught it later with
# nothing in between explaining the difference. A ban class added to the verb
# now reaches this hook without an edit here.

# The verb resolves its own paths under the cwd, so the project root is named
# rather than inherited. The payload carries an absolute file path, which is
# what lets the runner move without taking the argument out of reach.
